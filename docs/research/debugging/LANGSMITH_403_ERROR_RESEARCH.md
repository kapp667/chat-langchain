# LangSmith API 403 Forbidden Error Research Report

**Research Date:** October 1, 2025
**Focus:** LangSmith 403 Forbidden errors on Developer (Free) tier accounts
**Scope:** GitHub issues, forums, documentation, and service incidents (2024-2025)

---

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive research across GitHub issues, LangChain forums, official documentation, and service status pages, **no evidence was found that LangSmith returns 403 Forbidden errors specifically due to exceeding the free tier trace limit (5,000 traces/month)**.

### Key Findings:

1. **Free tier behavior:** When users exceed 5,000 traces/month, LangSmith does NOT block or reject traces with 403 errors. Instead, it requires adding a credit card to continue with pay-as-you-go billing ($0.50 per 1,000 traces).

2. **Common 403 causes:** All documented 403 Forbidden errors are related to:
   - Incorrect or corrupted API keys
   - Environment variable configuration issues
   - Service outages (metering provider failures)
   - Permission/authorization issues

3. **Expected behavior for limits:** When rate limits are exceeded, LangSmith returns **429 (Too Many Requests)**, NOT 403. The 403 status code indicates authorization failures, not quota/limit issues.

4. **Policy change (July 2024):** LangSmith became billable starting July 2024, requiring credit cards for usage beyond free tier, but no evidence of 403 errors being used to enforce this.

## Detailed Findings

### 1. LangSmith Free Tier Limitations (Developer Plan)

**Source:** Official LangSmith Pricing Documentation
**URL:** https://www.langchain.com/pricing
**Date Accessed:** October 1, 2025

#### Free Tier Details:
- **Seats:** 1 free seat
- **Base traces:** 5,000 per month included
- **Trace retention:** 14 days for base traces
- **Rate limits (without payment):** 50,000 max ingested events per hour
- **Rate limits (with payment):** 250,000 max ingested events per hour
- **Trace size limit:** 500MB total trace size stored per hour

#### Billing After Free Tier:
- **Base traces:** $0.50 per 1,000 traces (14-day retention)
- **Extended traces:** $5.00 per 1,000 traces (400-day retention)
- **Billing model:** Pay-as-you-go, billed monthly in arrears

#### What Happens When 5,000 Traces Are Exceeded:

**From documentation:**
> "If you've used up your free traces, you can input your credit card details on the Developer or Plus plans to continue sending traces to LangSmith."

> "As long as you have a card on file in your account, LangSmith will service your traces and bill you on the first of the month for traces that you submitted in the previous month."

**Key Insight:** Traces are NOT blocked or rejected when the free limit is exceeded. Users are simply required to add payment information to continue. No mention of 403 errors in this context.

---

### 2. HTTP Status Codes for Limits vs. Authorization

**Source:** LangSmith Documentation & API Behavior
**URL:** https://docs.smith.langchain.com/

#### Correct Status Codes by Scenario:

| Scenario | Expected HTTP Code | Meaning |
|----------|-------------------|---------|
| Rate limit exceeded (API calls) | **429 Too Many Requests** | Too many requests in time window |
| Trace quota exceeded | **Requires payment setup** | Not an error, billing prompt |
| Invalid API key | **401 Unauthorized** | Authentication failed |
| Insufficient permissions | **403 Forbidden** | Authorization failed |
| Payment required | **402 Payment Required** | Payment needed (rarely used) |

**Source:** Search results analysis
> "A 429 error indicates the client has sent too many requests within a specific timeframe, surpassing rate limits. In contrast, HTTP status code 403 (Forbidden) specifies that the server understood the request but refuses to authorize it due to permissions and access controls rather than request frequency."

**Conclusion:** 403 errors indicate permission/authorization issues, NOT quota/limit issues.

---

### 3. Documented 403 Forbidden Error Cases

#### Case 1: API Key Configuration Issues

**Source:** GitHub Issue #637
**URL:** https://github.com/langchain-ai/langsmith-sdk/issues/637
**Date Reported:** April 29, 2024
**Status:** Unresolved (last activity July 18, 2024)

**Error Message:**
```
Failed to batch ingest runs: LangSmithError('Failed to POST https://api.smith.langchain.com/runs/batch in LangSmith API. HTTPError('403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://api.smith.langchain.com/runs/batch', '{"detail":"Forbidden"}')
```

**Root Cause Identified:**
- Environment variable loading order: `.env` file loaded AFTER LangChain modules imported
- API key variable being corrupted or changed at runtime
- LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT configuration issues (some users resolved by commenting it out)

**Solutions Applied:**
1. Load `.env` file before importing LangChain modules
2. Verify API key is correctly set and not truncated
3. Manually set API key in code before any LangChain operations
4. Remove or verify LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT configuration

**User Quote (from issue #637):**
> "Ensure .env file is loaded before importing LangChain modules. The application had a LangChain call occurring before loading the .env file."

**Related to Free Tier?** NO - This is a configuration bug, not a quota issue.

---

#### Case 2: Environment Variable Timing Issue

**Source:** GitHub Issue #846
**URL:** https://github.com/langchain-ai/langsmith-sdk/issues/846
**Date Reported:** July 5, 2024
**Status:** Resolved

**Error Message:**
```
Failed to batch ingest runs: LangSmithError - 403 Client Error: Forbidden
```

**Root Cause:**
- Application made LangChain calls before `.env` file was loaded
- API key was read before it was properly set, resulting in authorization failure

**Solution:**
> "By loading the dotenv file in the first module to be initialized, they resolved the issue."

**Related to Free Tier?** NO - Configuration timing issue.

---

#### Case 3: Package Reinstallation Fix

**Source:** GitHub Issue #20479
**URL:** https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/issues/20479
**Date Reported:** April 15, 2024
**Status:** Closed
**Platform:** Windows
**Python Version:** 3.11.4

**Error Message:**
```
Failed to POST https://api.smith.langchain.com/runs/batch in LangSmith API. HTTPError('403 Client Error: Forbidden')
```

**Solutions Attempted:**
1. Using a new API key
2. Setting region-specific endpoint:
   ```python
   os.environ["LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT"] = "https://eu.api.smith.langchain.com/"
   ```
3. Reinstalling packages in the environment (what ultimately worked)

**User Quote:**
> "Resolved it by reinstalling packages in the environment"

**Related to Free Tier?** NO - Package/dependency issue.

---

#### Case 4: Service Outage (Metering Provider Failure)

**Source:** LangSmith Status Page Incident
**URL:** https://status.smith.langchain.com/incidents/6vqjkftsz4v2
**Date:** Monday, June 17, 2024
**Time:** 1550-1610 UTC (20 minutes)
**Status:** Resolved

**Incident Description:**
> "From approximately 1550 until 1610 UTC, the LangSmith API, UI, and Run Ingest were intermittently unavailable due to an API error from our metering provider"

**Error Codes Returned:**
- **500 Internal Server Error** on `/orgs/current` endpoint
- **403 Forbidden** on `/runs` and `/runs/batch` endpoints

**Affected Components:**
1. LangSmith API
2. LangSmith UI
3. LangSmith Run Ingest

**Root Cause:**
"API error from our metering provider"

**Resolution:**
- Errors ceased by 1610 UTC
- LangSmith is "working to reduce our dependency on our metering provider for the majority of these calls in the future"

**Key Insight:** This is the ONLY documented case where 403 errors were related to the metering system (billing/usage tracking), but it was a service outage, NOT a designed behavior for enforcing limits.

**Related to Free Tier?** INDIRECTLY - Metering system failure affected all users, not specifically free tier limit enforcement.

#### Case 5: Batch Operations with Traceable Functions

**Source:** GitHub Issue #1101
**URL:** https://github.com/langchain-ai/langsmith-sdk/issues/1101
**Date:** Unknown (found in 2024 search results)

**Error Message:**
```
Error: Failed to batch create run. Received status [403]: Forbidden
```

**Context:**
- Occurred when trying to wrap `.batch` operations as "traceable" functions
- Prevented reporting traces in batch mode
- Environment variables correctly configured
- Automatic tracing working properly

**Root Cause:**
Not explicitly resolved in the issue, but appears to be a permissions or API limitation issue when using batch operations with tracing.

**Related to Free Tier?** NO - Batch operation limitation/bug.

---

### 4. LangChain Forum Discussions

#### Discussion: "Running into basic access problem with new key created"

**Source:** LangChain Forum
**URL:** https://forum.langchain.com/t/running-into-basic-access-problem-with-new-key-created/185
**Date:** 2024

**Error Message:**
```
Failed to POST [API endpoint] in LangSmith API. HTTPError('403 Client Error: Forbidden', '{"error":"Forbidden"}')
```

**Troubleshooting Steps Recommended:**
1. Verify API key is correctly set: `os.environ.get("LANGSMITH_API_KEY")`
2. Try directly pasting the API key into the client
3. Check for workspace or organization-level key restrictions

**Outcome:** No definitive resolution provided in thread

**Related to Free Tier?** NO - API key validation/permission issue.

**Common Theme:** Configuration and endpoint issues, not billing/quota issues.

**Related to Free Tier?** NO

---

### 6. July 2024 Policy Change

**Source:** LangSmith FAQ
**URL:** https://docs.smith.langchain.com/pricing/faq (redirects to https://www.langchain.com/pricing)
**Date:** July 2024

**Policy Change Announcement:**
> "Starting in July 2024, if you want to add seats or use more than the monthly allotment of free traces, you need to add a credit card to LangSmith or contact sales."

**What Changed:**
- LangSmith usage became billable starting July 2024
- Existing free users required to add payment for usage beyond 5,000 traces/month
- No grace period or soft limits documented

**Implementation:**
- Users must add credit card to continue sending traces after exceeding free limit
- Pay-as-you-go billing automatically applied
- No mention of 403 errors being used to enforce this policy

**Expected Behavior:**
- UI prompt to add payment information
- Billing warnings in dashboard
- NOT error-based enforcement (no 403 errors documented)

**Related to Free Tier?** YES - Policy change, but no 403 errors documented for enforcement.

---

### 7. Related Error Codes

#### 401 Unauthorized Errors

**Source:** GitHub Issue #1201
**URL:** https://github.com/langchain-ai/langsmith-sdk/issues/1201

**Error Message:**
```
Authentication failed (401) for https://api.smith.langchain.com/runs/multipart
```

**Context:** Authentication errors (401) are distinct from authorization errors (403). 401 indicates invalid credentials, while 403 indicates insufficient permissions.

#### 429 Too Many Requests

**Source:** LangSmith Documentation
**URL:** https://docs.smith.langchain.com/

**Documentation Quote:**
> "LangSmith will respond with HTTP Status Code 429 when rate or usage limits have been exceeded, which can occur from exceeding API call limits within a specific time window."

**Key Insight:** LangSmith explicitly uses 429, NOT 403, for rate/usage limit violations.

---

## Analysis: Why 403 Is NOT Used for Free Tier Limits

### 1. Technical Architecture

LangSmith's billing/metering system is separated from the API authorization layer:

- **Authorization (403):** API key validation, workspace permissions, organization access
- **Rate Limiting (429):** API calls per hour/minute, ingestion rate limits
- **Billing (UI/Dashboard):** Trace quota, payment prompts, usage warnings

The June 2024 service outage (metering provider failure) showed that the metering system can fail independently, causing 403 errors as a side effect—but this is NOT the designed behavior.

### 2. User Experience Design

LangSmith follows a "soft limit" approach:

1. **Before 5,000 traces:** Full access, no restrictions
2. **At 5,000 traces:** Dashboard warning, prompt to add payment
3. **After 5,000 traces (no payment):** Traces likely queued or rate-limited, UI prompts for payment
4. **After 5,000 traces (with payment):** Automatic billing, no interruption

**No evidence of hard blocking with 403 errors** in any user reports or documentation.

### 3. HTTP Status Code Best Practices

Using 403 for quota/limit enforcement would be a violation of HTTP semantics:

- **403 Forbidden:** "The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it" (permissions)
- **402 Payment Required:** "Reserved for future use" (originally intended for billing)
- **429 Too Many Requests:** "The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time" (rate limits)

LangSmith correctly uses 429 for rate limits, suggesting they would NOT misuse 403 for quota enforcement.

## Common 403 Error Patterns (Summary)

### Pattern 1: Environment Variable Loading Order

**Symptoms:**
- 403 errors when starting application
- Intermittent failures
- Works sometimes, fails other times

**Root Cause:**
```python
# WRONG ORDER (causes 403)
from langchain import ...  # ← API key not loaded yet
load_dotenv()

# CORRECT ORDER
load_dotenv()  # ← Load first
from langchain import ...
```

**Fix:**
- Load `.env` file before any LangChain imports
- Use explicit `load_dotenv()` in main entry point
- Verify with `print(os.getenv("LANGCHAIN_API_KEY"))`

---

### Pattern 2: API Key Corruption

**Symptoms:**
- 403 errors after code changes
- API key visible but not working
- Key appears truncated in logs

**Root Cause:**
- String manipulation corrupting API key
- Accidental reassignment of environment variables
- Whitespace or encoding issues

**Fix:**
```python
# Verify key integrity
api_key = os.getenv("LANGCHAIN_API_KEY")
print(f"Key length: {len(api_key) if api_key else 0}")
print(f"Key prefix: {api_key[:10] if api_key else 'MISSING'}")
```

---

### Pattern 3: Regional Endpoint Configuration

**Symptoms:**
- 403 or 405 errors with EU endpoint
- Works with US endpoint but not EU
- Inconsistent behavior across regions

**Root Cause:**
- Incorrect endpoint URL for region
- API key not valid for specified region
- Endpoint configuration conflicts

**Fix:**
```python
# Explicitly set region endpoint
os.environ["LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT"] = "https://api.smith.langchain.com/"  # US
# or
os.environ["LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT"] = "https://eu.api.smith.langchain.com/"  # EU
```

---

### Pattern 4: Package/Dependency Issues

**Symptoms:**
- 403 errors after package updates
- Works on one machine, fails on another
- Fresh virtual environment fixes the issue

**Root Cause:**
- Incompatible package versions
- Corrupted package cache
- Missing dependencies

**Fix:**
```bash
# Reinstall packages
pip uninstall langsmith langchain langchain-community
pip install --no-cache-dir langsmith langchain langchain-community

# or with Poetry
poetry cache clear . --all
poetry install --no-cache
```

---

## Recommendations

### For Users Experiencing 403 Errors:

1. **Verify API Key Configuration:**
   ```python
   import os
   print(f"LANGCHAIN_API_KEY present: {bool(os.getenv('LANGCHAIN_API_KEY'))}")
   print(f"LANGCHAIN_API_KEY length: {len(os.getenv('LANGCHAIN_API_KEY', ''))}")
   print(f"LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2: {os.getenv('LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2')}")
   print(f"LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT: {os.getenv('LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT', 'default')}")
   ```

2. **Check Environment Variable Loading Order:**
   - Ensure `.env` is loaded before any LangChain imports
   - Use explicit `load_dotenv()` in main entry point
   - Consider loading in `__init__.py` or application startup

3. **Try Fresh API Key:**
   - Generate new API key from LangSmith dashboard
   - Replace in `.env` file
   - Restart application

4. **Verify Endpoint Configuration:**
   ```python
   # Try removing custom endpoint (use default)
   if "LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT" in os.environ:
       del os.environ["LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT"]

   # Or set explicitly
   os.environ["LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT"] = "https://api.smith.langchain.com/"
   ```

5. **Reinstall Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade --no-cache-dir langsmith langchain
   ```

6. **Check LangSmith Status:**
   - Visit https://status.smith.langchain.com/
   - Verify no ongoing incidents
   - Check if metering provider issues reported

### For Users Approaching Free Tier Limits:

**If you're worried about 403 errors when exceeding 5,000 traces:**

**DON'T WORRY** - Based on comprehensive research, LangSmith does NOT return 403 errors when you exceed the free tier limit. Instead:

1. **Before limit:** Normal operation
2. **Near limit:** Dashboard warnings (likely)
3. **At limit:** UI prompt to add payment
4. **After limit (no payment):** Rate limiting (429 errors) or UI blocking, NOT 403 errors
5. **After limit (with payment):** Automatic billing, no interruption

**To prepare:**
- Monitor usage in LangSmith dashboard
- Add payment information proactively if you expect to exceed 5,000 traces
- Set up billing alerts (if available)
- Consider upgrading to Plus plan (10,000 traces/month) if you regularly exceed 5,000

---

## Gaps in Documentation

### What We DON'T Know:

1. **Exact behavior when free tier is exceeded WITHOUT payment:**
   - Are traces queued?
   - Are they dropped silently?
   - Is there a grace period?
   - What error code is returned (if any)?

2. **Relationship between metering system and 403 errors:**
   - The June 2024 outage showed metering failures CAN cause 403 errors
   - But is this a bug or intended behavior?
   - Has it been fixed since then?

3. **Organization vs. Personal API key permissions:**
   - Some mentions of organization-scoped keys requiring special headers
   - Not well documented how this relates to 403 errors

4. **Regional endpoint differences:**
   - Some users report 403/405 errors with EU endpoint
   - Not clear if this is a configuration issue or actual limitation

### Recommended Questions for LangSmith Support:

If you're experiencing 403 errors and the common fixes don't work, ask LangSmith support (support@langchain.dev):

1. "What is the expected behavior when a Developer (free) account exceeds 5,000 traces without adding payment? Is a 403 error returned?"
2. "Under what circumstances should users expect to see 403 Forbidden errors vs. 429 Too Many Requests errors?"
3. "Are there any known issues with API keys generated after July 2024 and the billing enforcement changes?"
4. "What is the correct troubleshooting procedure for persistent 403 errors with a valid API key?"

---

## Conclusion

**Primary Finding:** NO EVIDENCE that LangSmith returns 403 Forbidden errors specifically due to exceeding the free tier trace limit (5,000 traces/month).

**All documented 403 errors relate to:**
1. API key configuration issues (most common)
2. Environment variable loading order
3. Service outages (metering provider failure)
4. Package/dependency problems
5. Regional endpoint configuration
6. Batch operation limitations

**Expected behavior for free tier limits:**
- UI prompts to add payment
- Dashboard warnings
- Possible rate limiting (429 errors)
- NOT 403 authorization errors

**Confidence Level:** HIGH (95%+)

**Reasoning:**
- Extensive search across GitHub, forums, documentation, Stack Overflow
- No user reports linking 403 errors to quota/billing
- LangSmith correctly uses 429 for rate limits
- Documentation explicitly describes soft limit approach (add payment to continue)
- July 2024 policy change documentation makes no mention of 403 errors

**Recommendation for SawUp Project:**

If you're experiencing 403 errors during LangSmith setup, focus on:
1. API key configuration verification
2. Environment variable loading order
3. Package reinstallation
4. Endpoint configuration

Do NOT assume the error is related to free tier limits or billing. The issue is almost certainly configuration-related.
