          "response_text": "- What LangGraph is\n  - LangGraph is a low-level orchestration framework for building, managing, and deploying long-running, stateful agents. It focuses on core agent capabilities like durable execution, streaming, human-in-the-loop, and comprehensive memory, and can be used standalone or alongside LangChain components. It offers both a Graph API and a functional API for defining agent flows [1](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/overview).\n  - Agent workflows are modeled explicitly as graphs composed of State (shared data), Nodes (functions that do work), and Edges (transitions/branching). Execution uses message passing inspired by Pregel; you compile the graph (with checks and runtime options) before running it. In short: nodes do the work; edges decide what to do next [4](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api).\n\n- How LangGraph differs from LangChain\n  - Scope and purpose\n    - LangChain is a broader framework with core abstractions (models, tools, retrievers), higher-level chains/agents, and integrations. LangGraph is an extension focused specifically on robust, stateful, multi-actor applications modeled as graphs, with both high-level agent interfaces and a low-level API for custom flows [2](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/architecture/).\n    - LangGraph was introduced to provide a lower-level orchestration layer missing in early LangChain, adding durable execution, streaming, short-term memory, and human-in-the-loop to support complex agent systems [7](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/philosophy).\n  - Orchestration model\n    - LangChain\u2019s LCEL is recommended for simpler orchestration (e.g., prompt + LLM + parser, simple retrieval). For complex state management, branching, cycles, or multi-agent setups, use LangGraph. You can still use LCEL inside individual LangGraph nodes when helpful [3](https://js.langchain.com/docs/concepts/lcel).\n  - State, persistence, and control\n    - LangGraph is built around explicit shared state and durable execution with checkpointers. Persistence is built-in but requires providing a checkpointer at compile time; otherwise you\u2019ll hit a MISSING_CHECKPOINTER error. It also supports breakpoints/interrupts for human-in-the-loop workflows and debugging [6](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/MISSING_CHECKPOINTER) [5](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/add-human-in-the-loop) [1](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/overview).\n  - Deployment posture\n    - LangServe is primarily for deploying simple LangChain Runnables. For LangGraph applications, use LangGraph Platform (beta), which is better suited to stateful, long-running agent workflows [2](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/architecture/).\n\n- When to use which (rules of thumb)\n  - If it\u2019s a single model call, call the model directly. For small chains (prompt + LLM + parser, simple RAG), use LCEL in LangChain. For complex flows with branching, loops, persistent state, multiple agents, human-in-the-loop, or long-running tasks, use LangGraph (and optionally use LCEL inside nodes) [3](https://js.langchain.com/docs/concepts/lcel) [1](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/overview).",

          "response_text": "- What checkpoints are and why Postgres: LangGraph persists a snapshot of graph state (a \u201ccheckpoint\u201d) after every super-step into a \u201cthread\u201d so you can resume, time-travel, add memory, or recover from failures. In production you typically back this with a database; LangGraph provides a Postgres checkpointer for durability and scale [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence) [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence#checkpointer-libraries).\n\n- Python: Postgres checkpointer setup\n  - Use PostgresSaver (sync) or AsyncPostgresSaver (async) from the Postgres checkpointer library. Pass it to graph.compile(checkpointer=...) so every super-step is saved to Postgres [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence#checkpointer-libraries).\n  - For encryption at rest, wrap the serializer: EncryptedSerializer.from_pycryptodome_aes() and pass it to PostgresSaver.from_conn_string(..., serde=serde); then run checkpointer.setup() to initialize/migrate the schema [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence#encryption) [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence).\n  - AsyncPostgresSaver: When executing graphs with .ainvoke/.astream, LangGraph uses async variants of the checkpointer methods (.aput/.aput_writes/.aget_tuple/.alist). Use AsyncPostgresSaver with async runs so persistence happens without blocking [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence#checkpointer-interface) [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence).\n\n- JavaScript/TypeScript: Postgres checkpointer setup\n  - Install @langchain/langgraph-checkpoint-postgres and instantiate PostgresSaver.fromConnString(DB_URI). Pass it to builder.compile({ checkpointer }) and call checkpointer.setup() the first time to create/migrate tables [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/add-memory#use-in-production) [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/add-memory#example-using-postgres-store).\n\n- How checkpoints behave (replay, history, fault-tolerance)\n  - Threads and checkpoints: each run persists to a thread; you can retrieve latest state or full history and resume from any checkpoint (time travel). Checkpointing also stores \u201cpending writes\u201d so successful nodes in a failed step aren\u2019t re-run on resume [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence) [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence#pending-writes).\n\n- Handling migrations between checkpoint versions\n  - Local/self-managed: Run checkpointer.setup() after upgrading the checkpointer library to apply schema migrations. This applies to both Python (PostgresSaver/AsyncPostgresSaver) and JS (PostgresSaver) usage [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence#encryption) [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/add-memory#example-using-postgres-store).\n  - LangGraph Server/Platform: The server automatically configures the checkpointer and manages persistence; schema migrations are built into the server. Notably, v0.4.28 consolidated the PostgreSQL checkpoint implementation and added PostgreSQL migrations to the queue server to prevent errors before migrations run [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/langgraph-platform/langgraph-server-changelog#v0428).\n  - Platform specifics: In managed deployments you don\u2019t configure the checkpointer yourself (any manual one is replaced), there\u2019s no direct DB access, and the DB persists until the deployment is deleted. Hybrid/Self-Hosted deployments can use a custom Postgres instance; migrations are applied via the server\u2019s setup/migration process [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/langgraph-platform/control-plane).\n\n- When to choose AsyncPostgresSaver vs PostgresSaver\n  - Use AsyncPostgresSaver for async graph execution to match .ainvoke/.astream and leverage the async checkpointer API; use PostgresSaver for synchronous runs. Both conform to the same BaseCheckpointSaver interface (same semantics; async adds .aput/.aget_tuple/.alist, etc.) [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence#checkpointer-interface) [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence).\n\nIf you need example code for Python or JS, share your runtime (Python vs Node), and I can provide a minimal snippet with PostgresSaver/AsyncPostgresSaver and setup/migration calls.",

          "response_text": "Below is a production-ready design for a multi-agent system in LangGraph that satisfies your requirements, with concrete architectural choices and code you can adapt.\n\nArchitecture decisions\n- Pattern: Use the \u201cTool Calling\u201d multi-agent pattern with a central controller that invokes specialist sub-agents as tools. This keeps routing centralized and predictable, and you can still mix in handoffs later if you want a specialist to take over a conversation. Customize each sub-agent\u2019s context (prompt, state slices) so they only see what they need. [1](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/multi-agent), [2](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langchain/multi-agent)\n- Human-in-the-loop (HITL): Implement HITL with LangGraph\u2019s interrupt + Command primitives. Interrupts pause the graph and surface structured payloads to reviewers; resuming with Command provides the decision (approve/reject/edit). Note: a checkpointer is required for HITL since state must persist across pauses. [5](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/add-human-in-the-loop), [1](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/multi-agent)\n- Persistence: Use a Postgres checkpointer for durable state. Enable encryption with EncryptedSerializer so persisted state is encrypted at rest. Always invoke the graph with a thread_id to persist and resume a conversation. For async runs, use AsyncPostgresSaver. [8](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence), [11](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence)\n- Fault tolerance and retries: Leverage LangGraph checkpointing to restart from the last successful step after failures. LangGraph stores \u201cpending writes\u201d for nodes that finished in a superstep so you don\u2019t re-run them when resuming, enabling robust retry semantics. [32](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence)\n- Observability: Send traces to a dedicated LangSmith project using the LANGSMITH_PROJECT environment variable (or override dynamically per run if needed). [15](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/log-traces-to-project)\n- Deployment: \n  - Self-hosted: run Postgres, configure PostgresSaver with encryption (LANGGRAPH_AES_KEY), and deploy your LangGraph app with process-level concurrency. Use AsyncPostgresSaver for async graphs. [8](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence)\n  - LangGraph Platform: if you deploy on the platform, checkpointing infra is handled automatically; still pass thread_id for persistence.

[5](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/add-human-in-the-loop), [8](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence)\n- Use thread_id consistently to persist the conversation/thread.

Please approve or suggest edits.\"\n    )\n    if response[\"type\"] == \"accept\":\n        pass\n    elif response[\"type\"] == \"edit\":\n        hotel_name = response[\"args\"][\"hotel_name\"]\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(f\"Unknown response type: {response['type']}\")\n    return f\"Successfully booked a stay at {hotel_name}.\"\n\nagent = create_react_agent(\n    model=\"anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-latest\",\n    tools=[book_hotel],\n    checkpointer=checkpointer,  # PostgresSaver from above\n)\n\n# Run until interrupt, then resume with a Command as shown earlier\n# This pattern pauses at the tool boundary and requires approval/edit before executing. [7]\n\nThis pattern integrates cleanly with multi-agent \u201ctool-calling\u201d orchestration, where the controller agent invokes sub-agents as tools and certain tools (write/delete/charge) are gated behind human approval. [1](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/multi-agent), [7](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/add-human-in-the-loop)\n\n3) Error recovery and retry logic\n\n- If a node fails, you can re-invoke the graph with the same thread_id to resume from the last successful checkpoint. LangGraph also stores \u201cpending writes\u201d for nodes that succeeded in the same superstep so they aren\u2019t re-run. [32](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence)\n\nPython\nconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"customer-123\"}}\n\ntry:\n    out = graph.invoke({\"messages\": [HumanMessage(content=\"Run end-to-end\")]}, config=config)\nexcept Exception as e:\n    # Log error; then retry. The graph resumes from the last checkpoint\n    # without re-running successful nodes thanks to pending writes.\n    out = graph.invoke({}, config=config)\nprint(out)\n\n4) LangSmith observability\n\n- Static: set the destination project for all traces in this run. [15](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/log-traces-to-project)\n  \nShell\nexport LANGSMITH_PROJECT=multi-agent-prod\n\n- Dynamic override (example using @traceable around an LLM call\u2014this can wrap your model/tool-calling function). [15](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/log-traces-to-project)\n\nPython\nfrom langsmith import traceable\n\n@traceable(run_type=\"llm\", name=\"Planner LLM\", project_name=\"multi-agent-prod\")\ndef call_planner_llm(...):\n    # your LLM call here\n    ...\n\nAdditional production notes\n- Asynchronous execution: If you run .ainvoke/.astream or other async paths, use AsyncPostgresSaver for the checkpointer. [8](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence)\n- Encryption: Enable at-rest encryption for all persisted state by supplying EncryptedSerializer; it reads the AES key from LANGGRAPH_AES_KEY. [8](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence), [32](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence)\n- Multi-agent context engineering: Carefully scope what each sub-agent sees. Avoid leaking unnecessary conversation history or intermediate reasoning; tailor prompts and I/O formats per agent. This is critical for quality and safety. [1](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/multi-agent)\n- Platform option: If you adopt LangGraph Platform, it handles checkpointing infra automatically; you still pass thread_id per run to unlock HITL, memory, and time-travel. [10](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/persistence)\n\nWhy this satisfies your requirements\n- HITL approval for critical decisions: Interrupt + Command in both nodes and tools; can approve/reject/edit before proceeding. [5](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/add-human-in-the-loop), [7](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/add-human-in-the-loop)\n- PostgreSQL checkpoints: PostgresSaver with encryption persists every superstep and supports restart/resume. [8](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence), [32](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence)\n- Error recovery and retry: Restart from last successful checkpoint; pending writes prevent rework across failures. [32](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence)\n- Observability: Route traces to a specific LangSmith project via env var or dynamic override. [15](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/log-traces-to-project)\n- Deployment strategy: Either self-host with Postgres + AES encryption + thread_id discipline, or use LangGraph Platform to manage persistence infra.

[1](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api) [2](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/overview)\n\nWhat LangGraph is (key points)\n- Graph model: programs are defined as a State (schema + reducers), Nodes (functions that do work), and Edges (logic that routes which node runs next). Execution uses message\u2011passing across discrete \u201csuper\u2011steps.\u201d [1](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api)  \n- Compile/run model: you build the graph (add nodes/edges), then compile it (checks, runtime args) before invoking. [1](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api)  \n- Built for orchestration: focused on durable execution, streaming, human\u2011in\u2011the\u2011loop, long\u2011running persistence, and production deployment of stateful agents. [2](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/overview)\n\nHow LangGraph differs from LangChain\n- Level of abstraction:\n  - LangGraph = low\u2011level orchestration for multi\u2011step, stateful workflows and agent control flow (explicit graph primitives). [2](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/overview)  \n  - LangChain = broader collection of components, integrations, and higher\u2011level abstractions (models, retrievers, tools, and agent/chaining patterns); it uses standard component interfaces to make swapping providers easy. [4](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langchain/philosophy)  \n- Relationship and migration:\n  - LangGraph was created as the preferred way to build any app that\u2019s more than a single LLM call; many of the older chains/agents were moved toward or reimplemented on top of LangGraph. [4](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langchain/philosophy)  \n  - LangChain continues to provide integrations, convenience components, and a higher\u2011level agent abstraction built on top of LangGraph. LangGraph itself can be used standalone (it was built by the LangChain team but does not require the rest of LangChain). [2](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/overview)\n\nPractical implications for developers\n- Use LangGraph when you need explicit control over stateful, long\u2011running or human\u2011in\u2011the\u2011loop agent workflows, durable execution, streaming updates, or fine\u2011grained orchestration of LLM/tool calls. [2](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/overview)  \n- Use LangChain (or its higher\u2011level agent/chain helpers) if you want quick composition of common LLM components and integrations without designing a custom graph from scratch.

          "response_text": "Short answer\n- LangGraph saves a checkpoint (a snapshot of the graph state at each super-step) to a thread; Postgres is supported via the langgraph-checkpoint-postgres package, which provides both synchronous (PostgresSaver) and asynchronous (AsyncPostgresSaver) implementations for production use [1].  \n\nHow checkpoints work with Postgres (high level)\n- Checkpointers implement a standard BaseCheckpointSaver interface with these core operations: put (save a checkpoint), put_writes (save pending/intermediate writes), get_tuple (fetch a checkpoint tuple by thread_id/checkpoint_id), and list (enumerate checkpoints matching filters). These are what LangGraph uses to persist and restore StateSnapshot and state history for a thread [1].  \n  [Docs: Persistence \u2014 langgraph checkpointer interface](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence) [1]\n\n- A checkpoint is saved per super-step and stored in a thread (an identifier you pass in the graph config as configurable.thread_id). Threads let you examine history, resume, time-travel, fork, or do human-in-the-loop interactions after runs have executed [1].  \n  [Docs: Threads & Checkpoints](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence) [1]\n\nAsyncPostgresSaver specifics\n- AsyncPostgresSaver is the async Postgres checkpointer you should use when running graphs asynchronously (using .ainvoke, .astream, .abatch). LangGraph will call the async variants of the interface methods (aput, aput_writes, aget_tuple, alist) when executing asynchronously [2].  \n  [Docs: Async checkpointer usage & method names](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence) [2]\n\n- The Postgres checkpointer is provided by the langgraph-checkpoint-postgres package (installed separately) and is intended for production / platform usage. Use its factory helpers (e.g., from_conn_string or other constructors provided by the package) to create the saver and pass it into graph.compile(checkpointer=...). In many examples the Postgres saver is used together with serializers and setup() where applicable [1].  \n  [Docs: Checkpointer libraries \u2014 PostgresSaver / AsyncPostgresSaver](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence) [1]\n\nSerialization, encryption and compatibility\n- Checkpointers serialize channel values using a Serializer protocol (langgraph-checkpoint provides JsonPlusSerializer by default). JsonPlusSerializer uses ormsgpack/JSON and handles many LangChain/LangGraph primitives, datetimes, enums, etc. If you need to support objects not covered by the default serializer (e.g., pandas DataFrames), JsonPlusSerializer supports a pickle_fallback option to fall back to pickle for unsupported objects [2].  \n  [Docs: Serializer & pickle fallback](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence) [2]\n\n- Persistence can be encrypted: you can wrap serialization with an EncryptedSerializer (e.g., from_pycryptodome_aes) which reads an AES key from LANGGRAPH_AES_KEY (or accepts an explicit key) and pass that serde into PostgresSaver/AsyncPostgresSaver when creating the saver [2].  \n  [Docs: EncryptedSerializer example](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence) [2]\n\nHandling migrations between checkpoint versions\n- The docs do not describe a built\u2011in \u201cautomatic migration\u201d tool for checkpoint schema or format changes. However, the checkpointer interface gives you the primitives to implement migrations yourself:\n  - enumerate historic checkpoints with list / alist to find checkpoints that need migration, and fetch each checkpoint tuple with get_tuple / aget_tuple; these return StateSnapshot-style data you can inspect and transform [1].  \n    [Docs: list / get_tuple purpose](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence) [1]\n  - after transforming/normalizing the state (for example, updating field names, decoding older serialized formats, or re-serializing under a new serde), write updated checkpoints back with put / aput (or write to a new thread/id to preserve history). The Serializer options (pickle_fallback, EncryptedSerializer) can help you decode old values during migration [2].  \n    [Docs: Serializer options & encryption](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence) [2]\n\n- Practical migration checklist (based on available primitives):\n  - Decide whether you will mutate existing checkpoint rows or write migrated snapshots to new threads (safer approach: new thread ids). The docs show threads contain accumulated state and that you pass thread_id at run time [1].  \n    [Docs: Threads and checkpoint persistence](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence) [1]\n  - Use alist / aget_tuple (async) to fetch old checkpoints and run deserialization/transformation code. Use JsonPlusSerializer(pickle_fallback=True) to read mixed old formats if needed, or use EncryptedSerializer with the original key to decrypt old blobs first if encryption was used [2].  \n    [Docs: aget_tuple / alist + JsonPlusSerializer/pickle/EncryptedSerializer](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence) [2]\n  - Write migrated checkpoints back with aput / put, and verify that graph.get_state() and graph.get_state_history() return the expected results. If you have an integrated platform (LangGraph Platform), its API endpoints can also be used to manage threads and state [1].  \n    [Docs: get_state_history and platform endpoints](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence) [1]\n\nIf you need exact migration steps for your DB schema or an example migration script\n- The documentation does not include a step\u2011by\u2011step migration script or automatic schema migration tool; if you want, tell me:\n  - whether your checkpointer data is encrypted,\n  - which serializer you used originally and which you want to move to,\n  - whether you prefer in-place updates or writing to new thread IDs,\nand I can propose a concrete migration plan (pseudo-code) using list/get_tuple + transform + put (or the async variants) based on the docs [1][2].  \n\nRelevant docs\n- LangGraph persistence (checkpointer interface, threads, checkpoints, PostgresSaver / AsyncPostgresSaver): https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence [1]  \n- Serializer, JsonPlusSerializer (pickle_fallback), EncryptedSerializer, and async method behavior: https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence [2]",

I include the architectural decisions, reasoning, and concrete code snippets (Python + JavaScript) that follow LangGraph best practices from the docs.\n\nHigh\u2011level architecture (components & responsibilities)\n- LangGraph graphs (multi\u2011agent) \u2014 implement agent logic as nodes or subgraphs; keep nodes deterministic and place non\u2011deterministic/side\u2011effecting code in tasks to enable safe replay and resumption. [LangGraph overview; Durable execution]([${7}](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/overview),[${10}](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/durable-execution))\n- Persistence (Postgres checkpoints) \u2014 use LangGraph Server (self\u2011hosted or LangGraph Platform) which persists checkpoints to Postgres and uses Redis for the task queue; each run is tracked as a thread and each super\u2011step becomes a checkpoint. Provide thread_id on invocation to persist and resume runs. [LangGraph Server; Persistence]([${4}](https://docs.langchain.com/langgraph-platform/langgraph-server),[${3}](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/persistence))\n- Human\u2011in\u2011the\u2011loop \u2014 use the persistence/threading mechanism + interrupts to pause execution and let humans inspect/modify checkpoints before resuming the run. Threads let you access historical state and resume from checkpoints. [Persistence; Durable execution]([${2}](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence),[${10}](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/durable-execution))\n- Error recovery & retry \u2014 wrap side effects and non\u2011deterministic work in tasks and make them idempotent; LangGraph persists task results so on resume it can reuse previous results; checkpoints include task error info for diagnostics and retries. Use explicit retry/backoff logic inside task implementations and rely on persisted checkpoints to avoid duplicated side effects. [Functional API / Serialization; Durable execution; Persistence]([${11}](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/functional-api),[${10}](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/durable-execution),[${3}](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/persistence))\n- Observability (LangSmith + OTel) \u2014 instrument runs with LangSmith tracing processors (or the LangSmith SDK integrations) to record spans, traces and evaluations. For self\u2011hosted LangSmith, export logs/metrics/traces via OpenTelemetry collectors to your backend. [LangSmith tracing & observability]([${6}](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/trace-with-openai-agents-sdk),[${19}](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/observability),[${17}](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/export-backend))\n\nDesign decisions (why and what to enforce)\n- Use LangGraph (StateGraph / functional API) as orchestration layer \u2014 it\u2019s explicitly designed for long\u2011running, stateful agents + durable execution and exposes both Graph and functional APIs. [LangGraph overview]([${7}](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/overview))\n- Persist everything to Postgres (via LangGraph Server) \u2014 LangGraph Server persists checkpoints to a database and requires Postgres for persistence with Redis as the task queue; this gives durable state, thread history, and recovery semantics. [LangGraph Server]([${4}](https://docs.langchain.com/langgraph-platform/langgraph-server))\n- Make all LLM calls & external APIs tasks (idempotent) \u2014 tasks\u2019 results are saved to state, letting you safely resume without re\u2011running side effects (critical for retries and human approvals). Use idempotency keys when calling external APIs. [Durable execution; Functional API]([${10}](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/durable-execution),[${11}](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/functional-api))\n- Human approval modeled as an interrupt + thread pause \u2014 persist state, surface it for review (via Studio/UI), then resume the thread. Threads & checkpoints are designed for human\u2011in\u2011the\u2011loop workflows. [Persistence; Durable execution]([${2}](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence),[${10}](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/durable-execution))\n- Observability: instrument per\u2011node/task spans and export to LangSmith \u2014 use LangSmith\u2019s tracing processors or SDK integrations so each run\u2019s trajectory, checkpoints and errors are visible. [LangSmith tracing]([${6}](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/trace-with-openai-agents-sdk))\n\nConcrete examples\n\n1) Minimal multi\u2011agent StateGraph (Python) \u2014 compile and invoke\n- This example shows a simple graph with two agent nodes and a typical compile/invoke flow (follow the LangGraph pattern). Use tasks for external calls in real apps. [LangGraph overview]([${7}](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/overview))\n\nCopy (Python):\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState, START, END\n\ndef agent_a(state: MessagesState):\n    # deterministic processing, returns new messages\n    return {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"ai\", \"content\": \"agent A response\"}]}\n\ndef agent_b(state: MessagesState):\n    # deterministic processing, returns new messages\n    return {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"ai\", \"content\": \"agent B response\"}]}\n\ngraph = StateGraph(MessagesState)\ngraph.add_node(agent_a)\ngraph.add_node(agent_b)\ngraph.add_edge(START, \"agent_a\")\ngraph.add_edge(\"agent_a\", \"agent_b\")\ngraph.add_edge(\"agent_b\", END)\ngraph = graph.compile()\n\n# invoke with initial input\ngraph.invoke({\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello\"}]})\n\n2) Persisting runs with a thread_id (JS-like config shown in docs)\n- When executing with persistence, you must supply a thread identifier so the checkpointer stores checkpoints under that thread. The platform / API manages persistence for you at runtime. [Persistence]([${3}](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/persistence))\n\nExample (config snippet showing thread_id):\n{\n  configurable: {\n    thread_id: \"customer-12345\"\n  }\n}\n\n- In production you will run LangGraph Server (Postgres + Redis) and deploy your graph to it; the server automatically saves checkpoints to the DB for each thread and super\u2011step. [LangGraph Server; Persistence]([${4}](https://docs.langchain.com/langgraph-platform/langgraph-server),[${3}](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/persistence))\n\n3) Human\u2011in\u2011the\u2011loop pattern (JS functional entrypoint + interrupt)\n- Use entrypoint/interrupt to pause a workflow, let a human inspect/approve, then resume. Persisted thread state lets you resume exactly where you paused. Keep side effects outside the main control flow (i.e., inside tasks). [Functional API; Persistence; Durable execution]([${11}](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/functional-api),[${3}](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/persistence),[${10}](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/durable-execution))\n\nCopy (JavaScript):\nimport { entrypoint, interrupt } from \"@langchain/langgraph\";\n\nconst approvalWorkflow = entrypoint(\n  { checkpointer, name: \"approvalWorkflow\" },\n  async (inputs) => {\n    // compute a recommended decision (deterministic)\n    const recommendation = { decision: \"upgrade\", reason: \"detected usage spike\" };\n\n    // persistable interrupt point \u2014 pauses the run for human approval\n    const humanDecision = interrupt(\"approval_needed\");\n\n    // resume here once humanDecision is stored on the thread\n    return { finalDecision: humanDecision || recommendation };\n  }\n);\n\nNotes:\n- Surface the checkpoint (thread) in your admin UI (LangGraph Studio or your own). A human reviewer can modify thread state and then the graph is resumed. Checkpoints store values and metadata for human\u2011in\u2011the\u2011loop interactions. [Persistence]([${3}](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/persistence))\n\n4) Tasks, idempotency, retry & error handling patterns\n- Principle: put side effects (HTTP API calls, DB writes, file writes) into tasks so their outputs are checkpointed and re\u2011used on resume. Ensure those tasks are idempotent (use idempotency keys or check for preexisting state) and implement retry/backoff inside task logic; LangGraph will persist failures and task metadata in checkpoints for diagnostics. [Functional API; Durable execution; Persistence]([${11}](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/functional-api),[${10}](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/durable-execution),[${3}](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/persistence))\n\nPseudo\u2011pattern (Python):\ndef external_api_task(args):\n    # implement retries with backoff here and idempotency checks\n    # e.g. check remote record for idempotency key before creating\n    try:\n        # call API\n        return {\"status\": \"ok\", \"result\": ...}\n    except TransientError as e:\n        # retry/backoff\n        raise\n\n- Use checkpoint/task metadata to implement controlled retries or to escalate to human review if an operation repeatedly fails. Checkpoint objects store task error info to guide recovery and retry flow. [Persistence]([${2}](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence))\n\n5) Observability: LangSmith integration & exporting traces\n- For full tracing, use LangSmith SDK/tracing processors (example below uses the OpenAI Agents tracing processor pattern). This will record spans for agent runs to LangSmith so you can inspect step\u2011by\u2011step execution, compare runs, and evaluate agent performance. [LangSmith tracing]([${6}](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/trace-with-openai-agents-sdk))\n\nExample (Python \u2014 set up tracing for agent SDK):\nfrom agents import Agent, Runner, set_trace_processors\nfrom langsmith.wrappers import OpenAIAgentsTracingProcessor\n\nagent = Agent(name=\"Approver\", instructions=\"...\")\n\nset_trace_processors([OpenAIAgentsTracingProcessor()])\n\nresult = Runner.run(agent, \"Why was this decision made?\")\nprint(result.final_output)\n\n- If you self\u2011host LangSmith, export logs/metrics/traces using an OpenTelemetry collector and wire metrics/traces to your observability backend (Datadog, Prometheus/Grafana, etc.). The LangSmith docs include collector examples and endpoints to scrape internal service metrics. [LangSmith export & collector docs]([${17}](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/export-backend),[${18}](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/langsmith-collector))\n\nOperational & deployment strategy\n- Run LangGraph Server as the control plane (either LangGraph Platform managed or self\u2011hosted). LangGraph Server deploys graphs/assistants, handles persistence and task queue. It requires Postgres (persistence) and Redis (task queue). [LangGraph Server]([${4}](https://docs.langchain.com/langgraph-platform/langgraph-server))\n- Postgres for checkpoints \u2014 deploy a highly available Postgres (managed or self\u2011hosted) to store threads/checkpoints and state snapshots. LangGraph Server expects Postgres as its supported database. [LangGraph Server; Persistence]([${4}](https://docs.langchain.com/langgraph-platform/langgraph-server),[${3}](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/persistence))\n- Redis for task queue \u2014 required by LangGraph Server. [LangGraph Server]([${4}](https://docs.langchain.com/langgraph-platform/langgraph-server))\n- LangSmith for observability \u2014 use LangSmith hosted or self\u2011hosted; self\u2011hosted deployments should configure OTel exporters/collectors per LangSmith docs for logs, metrics and traces. [LangSmith observability & export]([${19}](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/observability),[${17}](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/export-backend))\n- Kubernetes + Helm / Docker Compose \u2014 deploy LangGraph Server, Postgres, Redis, LangSmith (optional) and an OTel collector. Expose LangGraph APIs for your application services to invoke graphs/threads and use LangGraph Studio to review threads and run visual debugging. [LangGraph Server; LangSmith export]([${4}](https://docs.langchain.com/langgraph-platform/langgraph-server),[${17}](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/export-backend))\n- Security & operational notes:\n  - Ensure the DB and queue are secured and backed up.\n  - Use the thread model to limit data retention for privacy/retention policies (threads keep run history).\n  - If using the Enterprise LangGraph Server Docker image you will need a license key per docs. [LangGraph Server]([${4}](https://docs.langchain.com/langgraph-platform/langgraph-server))\n\nChecklist for production readiness\n- Graphs built deterministic; side effects in tasks only. [Durable execution; Functional API]([${10}](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/durable-execution),[${11}](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/functional-api))\n- Checkpointer enabled / runs started with thread_id so checkpoints persist in Postgres. [Persistence]([${3}](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/persistence))\n- Human approvals implemented as interrupts + UI that updates thread state before resuming. [Persistence; Durable execution]([${2}](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence),[${10}](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/durable-execution))\n- Retry/backoff and idempotency for external effects encapsulated in tasks. [Functional API; Durable execution]([${11}](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/functional-api),[${10}](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/durable-execution))\n- Tracing/instrumentation enabled with LangSmith and an OTel collector exporting metrics/traces to your observability backend. [LangSmith tracing & export]([${6}](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/trace-with-openai-agents-sdk),[${17}](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/export-backend))\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can:\n- Produce a concrete Kubernetes manifest / Helm chart that wires LangGraph Server + Postgres + Redis + OTel collector + LangSmith, or\n- Expand any snippet into a full working example (e.g., a multi\u2011node Python graph with explicit task wrappers, retry/backoff code, and a minimal human approval UI that updates thread state).\n\nWhich of those would you like me to generate next?",

Does not abstract prompts or architecture [(https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/overview)](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/overview)\n- **LangChain**: Higher-level abstractions for building LLM applications. If you're just getting started with agents or want higher-level abstractions, LangChain's agents are recommended [(https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/overview)](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/overview)\n\n### When to Use Each\n- **Use LangGraph when**: You need more control than high-level interfaces provide. As of October 2024, LangGraph became the preferred way to build any AI applications that's more than a single LLM call [(https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/philosophy)](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/philosophy)\n- **Use LangChain when**: You're just getting started or want simpler, higher-level abstractions\n\n### Core Capabilities\nLangGraph provides specialized infrastructure for:\n- **Durable execution**: Agents that persist through failures and resume from where they left off\n- **Human-in-the-loop**: Inspect and modify agent state at any point\n- **Comprehensive memory**: Both short-term working memory and long-term memory across sessions\n- **Streaming**: Real-time output streaming\n- **Time travel**: Navigate through agent execution history [(https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/overview)](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/overview)\n\n### Relationship\nWhile LangGraph can be used standalone, **you don't need to use LangChain to use LangGraph** [(https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/overview)](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/overview). However, they integrate seamlessly together, with LangChain components commonly used throughout LangGraph documentation.",

          "response_text": "# LangGraph Checkpoints with PostgreSQL\n\n## Overview\n\nLangGraph's persistence layer uses **checkpointers** to save graph state at every super-step. When using PostgreSQL, the `AsyncPostgresSaver` (or `PostgresSaver`) class provides production-ready checkpoint storage with full async support.\n\n## How Checkpoints Work\n\n### Core Concepts\n\n**Checkpoints** are snapshots of graph state saved at each super-step, containing:\n- `config`: Configuration associated with the checkpoint\n- `metadata`: Metadata for the checkpoint\n- `values`: Current state channel values\n- `next`: Tuple of node names to execute next\n- `tasks`: Information about next tasks, including error data if steps failed\n\n**Threads** are unique identifiers (`thread_id`) that group related checkpoints together, representing a sequence of runs[\u00b9](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence).\n\n## PostgreSQL Setup\n\n### Installation\n\n```bash\n# Install the PostgreSQL checkpointer package separately\npip install langgraph-checkpoint-postgres\n```\n\n### Basic Configuration\n\n```python\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.postgres import AsyncPostgresSaver\n\n# Create checkpointer from connection string\ncheckpointer = AsyncPostgresSaver.from_conn_string(\n    \"postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname\"\n)\n\n# Initialize the database schema\nawait checkpointer.setup()\n\n# Compile graph with checkpointer\ngraph = graph.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)\n```\n\n### Using with Thread IDs\n\n```python\n# Specify thread_id in config when invoking\nconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"conversation-123\"}}\n\n# Execute graph - state automatically persisted\nawait graph.ainvoke({\"messages\": [...]}, config)\n```\n\n## AsyncPostgresSaver Interface\n\nThe `AsyncPostgresSaver` implements the `BaseCheckpointSaver` interface with these key async methods:\n\n- **`.aput()`** - Store a checkpoint with configuration and metadata\n- **`.aput_writes()`** - Store intermediate writes (pending writes from successful nodes)\n- **`.aget_tuple()`** - Fetch a checkpoint for a given thread_id and checkpoint_id\n- **`.alist()`** - List checkpoints matching configuration and filter criteria[\u00b2](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence)\n\n## Advanced Features\n\n### Encryption\n\nEnable encryption for all persisted state:\n\n```python\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.serde.encrypted import EncryptedSerializer\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.postgres import AsyncPostgresSaver\n\n# Create encrypted serializer (reads LANGGRAPH_AES_KEY env var)\nserde = EncryptedSerializer.from_pycryptodome_aes()\n\n# Use with checkpointer\ncheckpointer = AsyncPostgresSaver.from_conn_string(\n    \"postgresql://...\", \n    serde=serde\n)\nawait checkpointer.setup()\n```\n\nWhen using LangGraph Platform, encryption is automatically enabled when `LANGGRAPH_AES_KEY` is present[\u00b3](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence).\n\n### Custom Serialization\n\nFor objects not supported by the default JSON serializer (like Pandas dataframes), use pickle fallback:\n\n```python\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.serde.jsonplus import JsonPlusSerializer\n\ncheckpointer = AsyncPostgresSaver.from_conn_string(\n    \"postgresql://...\",\n    serde=JsonPlusSerializer(pickle_fallback=True)\n)\n```\n\n## Migration Between Versions\n\n### General Upgrade Process\n\nWhen upgrading LangGraph versions that affect checkpointing:\n\n1. **Review release notes** for breaking changes in checkpoint schema\n2. **Backup your database** before upgrading\n3. **Test in staging** environment first\n4. **Run schema migrations** if required by the new version\n\n### Version Compatibility\n\nLangGraph follows an **N-2 support policy**:\n- **N (Current)**: Active support with new features\n- **N-1**: Critical security fixes only\n- **N-2 and older**: End of life, no support[\u2074](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/release-versions)\n\n### Migration Best Practices\n\n```python\n# 1. Check current checkpoint schema version\n# Query",
