This class allows you to store chat message history in a PostgreSQL database.\n\nHere's an example of how to use it:\n```python\nfrom langchain_community.chat_message_histories import SQLChatMessageHistory\n\nchat_message_history = SQLChatMessageHistory(\n    session_id=\"test_session\", connection_string=\"postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname\"\n)\n\nchat_message_history.add_user_message(\"Hello\")\nchat_message_history.add_ai_message(\"Hi\")\n```\nMake sure to replace the `connection_string` with your actual PostgreSQL connection string.\n\nAlternatively, you can also use the `PostgresLoader` class from the `langchain_community.document_loaders.generic` module [2](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/document_loaders/source_code/), but this is more suited for loading documents from PostgreSQL, not specifically for saving conversation history.\n\nNote: You need to install the `langchain-community` package and the `SQLAlchemy` package to use the `SQLChatMessageHistory` class. You can do this by running `pip install langchain-community SQLAlchemy` [1](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/memory/sql_chat_message_history/).",

This allows you to control how long each step can take before timing out [1](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/migrate_agent/).\n* **Use a more efficient LLM**: If your agent is taking too long to respond, it might be due to the LLM being used. Consider using a more efficient LLM that can process complex questions faster [2](https://docs.langchain.com/langgraph-platform/faq).\n* **Optimize your agent's graph structure**: The structure of your agent's graph can significantly impact its performance. Make sure that your graph is optimized for the tasks it needs to perform, and that there are no unnecessary nodes or edges that could be causing delays [3](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api).\n* **Implement retry logic**: You can implement retry logic in your agent to retry failed steps or entire conversations. This can help improve resilience and reduce the impact of timeouts [4](https://docs.langchain.com/langgraph-platform/troubleshooting-studio).\n* **Monitor and analyze performance**: Use tools like LangSmith to monitor and analyze your agent's performance. This can help you identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement [5](https://docs.langchain.com/langgraph-platform/langgraph-server).\n\nSome example code to increase the step timeout:\n```python\nlanggraph_agent_executor = create_react_agent(model, tools=tools)\nlanggraph_agent_executor.step_timeout = 60  # increase timeout to 1 minute\n```\nNote: The above code is just an example and may need to be adapted to your specific use case. \n\nAlso, you can use the `asyncio` library to set a single max timeout for an entire run:\n```python\nimport asyncio\n\nasync def stream(langgraph_agent_executor, inputs):\n    async for chunk in langgraph_agent_executor.astream(\n        {\"messages\": [(\"human\", query)]}\n    ):\n        print(chunk)\n        print(\"------\")\n\ntry:\n    task = asyncio.create_task(\n        stream(langgraph_agent_executor, {\"messages\": [(\"human\", query)]})\n    )\n    await asyncio.wait_for(task, timeout=60)  # set timeout to 1 minute\nexcept asyncio.TimeoutError:\n    print(\"Task Cancelled.\")\n```",

This can be achieved through techniques like Chain of Thought (CoT) or Tree of Thoughts (ToT) [1](https://js.langchain.com/docs/how_to/qa_chat_history_how_to).\n* **Step 2: Search**: For each sub-question, use a retrieval system to search for relevant documentation.
