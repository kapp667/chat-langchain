      "response_full": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a comprehensive overview of LangGraph and how it differs from LangChain.\n\n## What is LangGraph?\n\nLangGraph is a **low-level orchestration framework** specifically designed for building, managing, and deploying long-running, stateful agents [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/overview). It's trusted by companies like Klarna, Replit, and Elastic for creating sophisticated agent systems [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/overview).\n\n### Core Benefits of LangGraph:\n\n* **Durable execution**: Build agents that persist through failures and can run for extended periods, resuming from where they left off [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/overview)\n* **Human-in-the-loop**: Incorporate human oversight by inspecting and modifying agent state at any point [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/overview)\n* **Comprehensive memory**: Create stateful agents with both short-term working memory for ongoing reasoning and long-term memory across sessions [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/overview)\n* **Production-ready deployment**: Deploy sophisticated agent systems with scalable infrastructure designed for stateful, long-running workflows [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/overview)\n\n## How LangGraph Differs from LangChain\n\n### Level of Abstraction\n* **LangGraph** is \"very low-level, and focused entirely on agent orchestration\" [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/overview)\n* **LangChain** provides higher-level abstractions for getting started with common applications [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/philosophy)\n\n### Purpose and Focus\n* **LangGraph** is specifically designed for \"long-running, stateful agents\" and workflows that require precise control over execution flow [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/philosophy)\n* **LangChain** originally focused on LLM abstractions and \"chains\" - predetermined steps of computation for common use cases like RAG [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/philosophy)\n\n### Historical Context\nLangGraph was released in February 2024 as an open-source library to address the need for a \"low-level orchestration layer that allowed developers to control the exact flow of their agent\" [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/philosophy). This came after developers building with LangChain discovered they needed more control than the high-level interfaces provided [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/philosophy).\n\n### Current Recommendation\nAs of October 2024, \"LangGraph becomes the preferred way to build any AI applications that's more than a single LLM call\" [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/philosophy). Most chains and agents in LangChain were marked as deprecated with guides on how to migrate them to LangGraph [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/philosophy).\n\n### Integration\nWhile LangGraph can be used standalone, it integrates seamlessly with LangChain products, giving developers a full suite of tools for building agents [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/overview)."

      "response_full": "Based on the provided documentation, here's how LangGraph checkpoints work with PostgreSQL:\n\n## PostgreSQL Checkpointers\n\nLangGraph provides `PostgresSaver` and `AsyncPostgresSaver` checkpointers through the `langgraph-checkpoint-postgres` library, which needs to be installed separately [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence). These are considered advanced checkpointers ideal for production use [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence).\n\n## AsyncPostgresSaver Usage\n\nFor asynchronous graph execution (using `.ainvoke`, `.astream`, `.abatch`), you should use `AsyncPostgresSaver` [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence). Here's how to set it up:\n\n```python\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.postgres import PostgresSaver\n\ncheckpointer = PostgresSaver.from_conn_string(\"postgresql://...\", serde=serde)\ncheckpointer.setup()\n```\n\n## Checkpointer Interface\n\nThe PostgreSQL checkpointer implements the `BaseCheckpointSaver` interface with these key methods [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence):\n\n* `.put` - Store a checkpoint with its configuration and metadata\n* `.put_writes` - Store intermediate writes linked to a checkpoint (pending writes)\n* `.get_tuple` - Fetch a checkpoint tuple for a given configuration (thread_id and checkpoint_id)\n* `.list` - List checkpoints that match given configuration and filter criteria\n\n## Automatic Configuration on LangGraph Platform\n\nWhen using LangGraph Platform, checkpointers are automatically configured and you don't need to set them up manually [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/langgraph-platform/control-plane). Any manually configured checkpointer will be replaced by the automatically configured one [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/langgraph-platform/control-plane).\n\n## Migration Between Checkpoint Versions\n\nThe search results do not contain specific information about handling migration between checkpoint versions in PostgreSQL. The documentation mentions that \"the database is never deleted until the deployment itself is deleted\" [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/langgraph-platform/control-plane), but does not provide guidance on version migration strategies.\n\nFor detailed information about checkpoint version migration, you would need to consult additional LangGraph documentation or resources specifically covering database schema migrations and version compatibility."

      "response_full": "Based on the provided documentation, I can outline a production-grade multi-agent LangGraph system that addresses your requirements. Here's the architectural design and implementation approach:\n\n## Architectural Overview\n\nLangGraph is specifically designed as a \"low-level orchestration framework for building, managing, and deploying long-running, stateful agents\" with built-in support for your requirements [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/overview).\n\n### Core Components\n\n**State Management & Persistence**\n- Use `PostgresSaver` or `AsyncPostgresSaver` for production-grade checkpointing [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence)\n- Thread-based architecture for conversation persistence [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence)\n- Each agent interaction is associated with a unique `thread_id`\n\n**Human-in-the-Loop Integration**\n- Configure `HumanInTheLoopMiddleware` with specific interrupt policies [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/human-in-the-loop)\n- Define which tools require approval (`interrupt_on` configuration)\n- Support for different response types: accept, edit, or respond [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/human-in-the-loop)\n\n## Implementation Example\n\n```python\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState, START, END\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.postgres import AsyncPostgresSaver\nfrom langchain_core.tools import tool\nfrom langchain_community.chat_models import ChatOpenAI\nimport os\n\n# 1. Define critical tools that require human approval\n@tool\ndef execute_financial_transaction(amount: float, recipient: str):\n    \"\"\"Execute financial transaction - requires human approval\"\"\"\n    return f\"Transaction of ${amount} to {recipient} pending approval\"\n\n@tool  \ndef update_production_database(query: str):\n    \"\"\"Update production database - requires human approval\"\"\"\n    return f\"Database update: {query} pending approval\"\n\n@tool\ndef read_data(query: str):\n    \"\"\"Safe read operation - no approval needed\"\"\"\n    return \"Data read successfully\"\n\n# 2. Configure human-in-the-loop middleware\nfrom langgraph.types import Command\nfrom langgraph.prebuilt import create_agent\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver\n\nagent = create_agent(\n    model=\"openai:gpt-4o\",\n    tools=[execute_financial_transaction, update_production_database, read_data],\n    middleware=[\n        HumanInTheLoopMiddleware(\n            interrupt_on={\n                \"execute_financial_transaction\": True,  # All actions allowed\n                \"update_production_database\": {\n                    \"allow_accept\": True, \n                    \"allow_respond\": True\n                },\n                \"read_data\": False,  # No approval needed\n            },\n            description_prefix=\"Critical action pending approval\",\n        ),\n    ],\n    # 3. Production persistence with PostgreSQL\n    checkpointer=AsyncPostgresSaver.from_conn_string(\n        \"postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/langgraph\"\n    ),\n)\n```\n\n## Error Recovery & Retry Logic\n\nLangGraph's persistence layer provides built-in fault tolerance:\n\n- **Automatic checkpointing** at every super-step enables recovery from failures [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence)\n- **Pending writes** are stored when nodes fail, preventing re-execution of successful operations [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence)\n- **State restoration** from any checkpoint enables time-travel debugging and recovery\n\n```python\n# Error recovery example - resume from last checkpoint\nconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"transaction_123\"}}\n\ntry:\n    result = agent.invoke(\n        {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Transfer $1000 to vendor\"}]},\n        config=config\n    )\nexcept Exception as e:\n    # System automatically persists state - can resume from last checkpoint\n    print(f\"Error occurred, state preserved. Resume with: {config}\")\n```\n\n## Human-in-the-Loop Workflow\n\n```python\n# Run until interrupt\nconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"critical_operation_456\"}}\nresult = agent.invoke(\n    {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Update customer credit limits\"}]},\n    config=config\n)\n\n# Check for interrupts requiring human approval\nif '__interrupt__' in result:\n    interrupt_data = result['__interrupt__']\n    print(f\"Actions requiring approval: {interrupt_data}\")\n    \n    # Present to human reviewer, then resume\n    # Option 1: Accept as-is\n    agent.invoke(\n        Command(resume=[{\"type\": \"accept\"}]),\n        config=config\n    )\n    \n    # Option 2: Edit parameters\n    agent.invoke(\n        Command(resume=[{\n            \"type\": \"edit\", \n            \"args\": {\"amount\": 500}  # Modified parameters\n        }]),\n        config=config\n    )\n```\n\n## Observability with LangSmith\n\n- **Automatic tracing** of agent execution paths and state transitions [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/overview)\n- **Runtime metrics** and detailed visibility into complex agent behavior [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/overview)\n- **Evaluation tools** for agent trajectories and performance monitoring\n\n## Deployment Strategy\n\n**LangGraph Platform** provides the recommended deployment approach:\n\n- **Purpose-built platform** for stateful, long-running workflows [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/overview)\n- **Scalable infrastructure** designed for agent orchestration challenges [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/overview)\n- **LangGraph Studio** for visual prototyping and iteration [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/overview)\n\n## Multi-Agent Architecture\n\nFor complex multi-agent systems, leverage subgraphs and proper state management:\n\n```python\n# Define specialized agents with their own tools and approval policies\nfinancial_agent = create_agent(\n    model=\"openai:gpt-4o\",\n    tools=[execute_financial_transaction],\n    middleware=[HumanInTheLoopMiddleware(interrupt_on={\n        \"execute_financial_transaction\": True\n    })],\n    checkpointer=AsyncPostgresSaver.from_conn_string(\"...\")\n)\n\ndata_agent = create_agent(\n    model=\"openai:gpt-4o\", \n    tools=[update_production_database, read_data],\n    middleware=[HumanInTheLoopMiddleware(interrupt_on={\n        \"update_production_database\": True,\n        \"read_data\": False\n    })],\n    checkpointer=AsyncPostgresSaver.from_conn_string(\"...\")\n)\n\n# Orchestrate multi-agent workflow with shared state\ndef orchestrator(state: MessagesState):\n    # Route to appropriate agent based on content\n    if \"financial\" in state[\"messages\"][-1].content:\n        return financial_agent.invoke(state)\n    else:\n        return data_agent.invoke(state)\n```\n\n## Key Production Considerations\n\n1. **Persistent Checkpointing**: Always use `AsyncPostgresSaver` in production (not `InMemorySaver`) [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/human-in-the-loop)\n\n2. **Thread Management**: Implement proper thread lifecycle management for long-running conversations\n\n3. **Monitoring**: Leverage LangSmith for comprehensive observability and debugging\n\n4. **Security**: Consider encrypted serialization for sensitive state data [citation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence)\n\nThis architecture provides a robust foundation for production-grade multi-agent systems with all your required capabilities built directly into LangGraph's core infrastructure."
